## ‚öíÔ∏è Installation

There's not much installation, but as mentioned before its highly configurable!

- Fill in [.env](https://github.com/Dqrshan/Tracker/blob/main/.env.example) file with your credentials:
  - `token=` your bot's token, you can find it [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
  - `guild=` your server's ID where slash commands will be registered. You must enable **Developer Mode** for copying IDs (`Settings ‚ûî Advanced ‚ûî Developer Mode`).

```env
token=AbCdEfGhIj.1234.5678
guild=1234567890
```

And that's it! You are good to go!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hosting

I do not encourage hosting this repository on websites such as [`repl.it`](https://repl.it) and [`glitch`](https://glitch.com). Unless you have hacker plan, your data is exposed to everyone, since the database is locally stored via sqlite. Glitch often messes up the local storage system, causing your database to corrupt.

- I would suggest using **pterodactyl nodes** or a **VPS** (Virtual Private Server).
- You could, mess around with the code, and change the database dialects and host on your preferred choice!
